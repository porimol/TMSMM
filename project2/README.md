### README: Analyzing Trump's 2024 Campaign Speeches

---

#### **Project Title**:  
**Sentiment and Topic Analysis of Trump's 2024 Campaign Speeches**

---

#### **Project Description**:  
This project aims to analyze the speeches delivered by Donald Trump during his 2024 campaign across various states. The analysis focuses on sentiment detection and topic categorization, highlighting trends in campaign rhetoric and public messaging. The speeches are categorized into key campaign topics, including Gun Laws, Climate, Crime, Healthcare, Taxes, Ukraine Aid, Abortion, Immigration, and Economy.

By leveraging advanced text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project provides insights into:
- Sentiment trends across states and topics.
- Speech patterns and campaign strategies tailored to specific regions.
- Key themes and topics emphasized in the campaign.

### **1. Project Objectives**
- Perform sentiment analysis on the campaign speeches.  
- Categorize speech content into predefined topics.  
- Explore trends in sentiment and topics across states and over time.  
- Provide visualizations and insights for deeper understanding.

---

### **2. Data Collection**
- **Source**: Transcripts of speeches delivered by Trump in 2024 during his campaign events.  
- **Metadata**: Information about the speech's location (state), date, and associated campaign topics.  
- **Data Format**: Cleaned text data with associated metadata in a CSV or JSON format.

---

### **3. Methodology**
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning: Removing stopwords, special characters, and URLs.  
   - Tokenization and normalization: Breaking text into tokens and converting them to a standard format.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models like VADER and transformer-based models.  
   - Categorize sentiments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

3. **Topic Categorization**:
   - Supervised classification for predefined topics.
   - Unsupervised topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to detect hidden themes.  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze and visualize sentiment and topic trends over time and across states.  
   - Generate word clouds and N-gram analyses for insights.

5. **Text Clustering**:
   - Group similar speeches using clustering algorithms and visualize them in 3D.  

6. **Visualization**:
   - Use interactive Plotly dashboards for visual exploration.

### **4. Technologies and Libraries**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **NLP**: NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, Hugging Face Transformers  
  - **Text Analysis**: Scikit-learn, TextBlob  
  - **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: t-SNE, PCA  
  - **Clustering**: KMeans, DBSCAN  

---

### **5. Results**
- **Sentiment Trends**:  
  - Sentiment distribution across states and campaign topics.  
  - Visualizations of sentiment change over time.

- **Topic Insights**:  
  - Top campaign topics by state and overall.  
  - Word clouds for prominent topics and sentiment categories.

- **Clustering**:  
  - Grouped speeches based on similarity in themes.  
  - Interactive 3D visualization of clusters.  

---

### **6. Challenges and Limitations**
- **Speech Quality**: Variability in transcript quality and completeness.  
- **Model Bias**: Pre-trained sentiment models may exhibit biases.  
- **Topic Ambiguity**: Some speech content may overlap multiple topics, complicating categorization.  

---

### **7. Future Work**
- Fine-tune transformer models (e.g., BERT) for domain-specific sentiment analysis.  
- Incorporate audience reactions (e.g., social media sentiment) for deeper insights.  
- Analyze speeches from other candidates for comparative analysis.
